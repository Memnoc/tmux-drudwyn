# Daily use

[Documentation](README.md) · [Project home](../README.md)

In this guide, `prefix` means your tmux prefix key (normally `Ctrl+b`). Press it, release it, then press the next key. Uppercase letters use Shift; `C-s` means `Ctrl+s`.

## Find your workspace

See what is running, what needs attention, and where to act without leaving tmux.

| Surface             | What it answers                               | Open it        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Status bar          | Where am I, what changed, and who needs me?   | Always visible |
| Workspace Navigator | What is running across all tmux sessions?     | `prefix + w`   |
| Workspace Cockpit   | What should I review, open, start, or finish? | `prefix + P`   |

### Status at a glance

<img src="images/design/status-bar-anatomy.png" alt="Annotated tmux status bar split into three zones: ordinary workspaces on the left, content-blind Git context in the centre, and lifecycle-colored agents on the right, with a variant showing the active-workspace highlight">

| Color | State   | Meaning                  |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| Blue  | Working | The agent is active      |
| Gold  | Waiting | The agent needs input    |
| Green | Review  | Work is ready to inspect |
| Red   | Failed  | The agent or task failed |

Only lifecycle state, branch, and Git counts are shown. The default Rust
implementation never reads prompts, responses, or terminal scrollback.

### Find work, then act

Use the session navigator to find a session, the workspace navigator to find a window, and the cockpit to act on a workspace.

<img src="images/navigator-cockpit-surfaces.png" alt="Comparison of three complementary tmux-agent-watch surfaces: the Session Navigator for switching tmux sessions, the Workspace Navigator for finding windows and agents across sessions, and the Workspace Cockpit for starting, reviewing, opening, and finishing agent work">

| Surface             | What you can do                                      | Use it when                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Session Navigator   | Find and switch tmux sessions                        | You know which session you want                |
| Workspace Navigator | Find any window or active agent across every session | You need to locate a workspace or agent        |
| Workspace Cockpit   | Start, review, open, and finish agent work           | You need context or want to act on a workspace |

| Cockpit action | Result                                                         | Direct key   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Start          | Create a linked worktree, choose an agent, and begin the task  | `prefix + W` |
| Review         | Show agents waiting, failed, or ready for review               | —            |
| Jump           | Open a live agent workspace                                    | `prefix + w` |
| Finish         | Remove a clean, integrated worktree while retaining its branch | `prefix + X` |

<img src="images/design/lifecycle-flow.png" alt="Lifecycle flow diagram: start task creates a worktree, the agent moves to working, then needs attention when waiting or failed, then review when idle and ready, then finish safely once clean and merged">

Finish refuses primary checkouts, dirty worktrees, and branches not integrated
into the configured base branch.

### Responsive layout

The status bar adapts to narrower terminals and tiled windows.

<img src="images/design/responsive-layouts.png" alt="The status bar at three widths: wide showing every workspace and agent, narrow collapsing inactive workspace labels to an arrow, and compact under 80 columns sharing project, Git, lifecycle, and navigator cues in one flow">

Workspace, Git, lifecycle, and navigation context remain visible as the
terminal narrows; labels collapse before information collides.

## Keyboard reference

| Key              | Action                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix + H`     | Open help (`q` or Escape closes it)            |
| `prefix + P`     | Open the Workspace Cockpit                     |
| `prefix + w`     | Open the grouped workspace navigator           |
| `prefix + C-w`   | Open tmux's native window tree                 |
| `prefix + s`     | Open the compact session navigator             |
| `prefix + S`     | Open tmux's native session tree                |
| `prefix + C-s`   | Save all sessions (tmux-resurrect)              |
| `prefix + a`     | Jump to the oldest agent needing attention     |
| `prefix + W`     | Create a worktree and start an agent           |
| `prefix + X`     | Finish the selected clean, integrated worktree |
| `prefix + Space` | Toggle the optional legacy sidebar             |
| `prefix + A`     | Recreate a stuck legacy sidebar                |

Inside either navigator, these shortcuts act on the selected item:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k` or arrow keys | Move selection |
| `Enter` | Switch to the selected session or window |
| `/` | Filter the list |
| `r` | Rename the selected session (`prefix + s`) or window (`prefix + w`) |
| `x` | Kill the selected item after confirmation |
| `s` | Save all sessions with tmux-resurrect |
| `Esc` / `q` | Close the navigator |

Renaming starts with the current name. Use `Backspace` to delete, `Enter` to
apply, and `Esc` to cancel. The navigator stays open and reports any error so
you can correct the name. Press `s` afterward to save the updated layout with
Resurrect.

Inside either navigator, select an item and press `x`, then `y` to confirm killing
it (`Esc` or `n` cancels). In `prefix + w`, this kills the selected tmux window
and all its panes, including any links to that window in other sessions. In
`prefix + s`, it kills the selected session; windows linked to another session
survive. Running processes in closed panes stop. Git worktrees and files remain
on disk. The list refreshes after a kill; killing the session hosting the popup
may close it and detach its clients.

Existing tmux window navigation, naming, and pane zoom continue to work.

## Worktrees from the command line

Use the cockpit for everyday work. For automation, run these scripts from the
plugin checkout directory:

```sh
scripts/worktree-new.sh feature/auth opencode
scripts/worktree-new.sh --repo /path/to/repository feature/auth opencode
scripts/worktree-remove.sh feature/auth
```

Extra arguments after the branch are used as the exact agent command. Set
`AGENT_WATCH_WORKTREE_ROOT` to change the worktree parent directory. Removal
refuses dirty worktrees and retains the branch.

## Session persistence

Live state is stored in tmux window options. Use `tmux-resurrect` and
`tmux-continuum` to restore sessions, windows, layouts, and working directories.
Load Continuum after themes that replace `status-right`.

Press `s` inside either navigator to save **all sessions** through the installed
Resurrect plugin without closing the navigator. The footer reports the result.
After cleaning up windows or sessions, save before exiting tmux so the next
restore uses the updated layout. Kills do not automatically save; if killing the
session hosting the popup closes it, reopen a navigator in a remaining session
and save there.

Resurrect's default global save shortcut is `prefix + Ctrl+s`. Agent Watch leaves
that key available and puts the native session tree on `prefix + Shift+s`.
If upgrading from a version that used `Ctrl+s` for the native tree, reload your
tmux configuration with Resurrect enabled to restore its save binding. Remove
any explicit `@agent-watch-native-session-key C-s` override that would reclaim it.

Saving requires `tmux-resurrect` to be loaded. Agent Watch delegates to its
`@resurrect-save-script-path` and creates no separate snapshot. Resurrect controls
what is saved, including pane contents if you enabled its capture option.
