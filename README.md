## Install

### 1. Add the plugin

With [TPM](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm), add this to `.tmux.conf`:

```tmux
set -g @plugin 'memnoc/tmux-agent-watch'
```

Install plugins with `prefix + I`, or reload tmux if the plugin is already
checked out.

### 2. Install the binary

TPM does not compile Rust. Run the bundled installer once after installing or
updating the plugin:

```sh
~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-agent-watch/install.sh
```

It downloads the correct Linux or macOS build, verifies its checksum, and
installs it to `~/.local/bin`.

To build from source instead:

```sh
cargo install --locked --path ~/.tmux/plugins/tmux-agent-watch
```

Reload tmux, then press `prefix + P` to open the Workspace Cockpit. Agents can
still be started normally; no special launcher is required.

## How it works

See what is running, what needs attention, and where to act without leaving tmux.

| Surface             | What it answers                               | Open it        |
| ------------------- | --------------------------------------------- | -------------- |
| Status bar          | Where am I, what changed, and who needs me?   | Always visible |
| Workspace Navigator | What is running across all tmux sessions?     | `prefix + w`   |
| Workspace Cockpit   | What should I review, open, start, or finish? | `prefix + P`   |

### Status at a glance

<img src="docs/images/design/status-bar-anatomy.png" alt="Annotated tmux status bar split into three zones: ordinary workspaces on the left, content-blind Git context in the centre, and lifecycle-colored agents on the right, with a variant showing the active-workspace highlight">

| Color | State   | Meaning                  |
| ----- | ------- | ------------------------ |
| Blue  | Working | The agent is active      |
| Gold  | Waiting | The agent needs input    |
| Green | Review  | Work is ready to inspect |
| Red   | Failed  | The agent or task failed |

Only lifecycle state, branch, and Git counts are shown. The default Rust
implementation never reads prompts, responses, or terminal scrollback.

### Find work, then act

Sessions, Workspaces and Cockpit were all re-designed to be more compact, visible and on point with the rest of the look and feel.

<img src="docs/images/navigator-cockpit-surfaces.png" alt="Comparison of three complementary tmux-agent-watch surfaces: the Session Navigator for switching tmux sessions, the Workspace Navigator for finding windows and agents across sessions, and the Workspace Cockpit for starting, reviewing, opening, and finishing agent work">

| Surface             | What you can do                                      | Use it when                                    |
| ------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Session Navigator   | Find and switch tmux sessions                        | You know which session you want                |
| Workspace Navigator | Find any window or active agent across every session | You need to locate a workspace or agent        |
| Workspace Cockpit   | Start, review, open, and finish agent work           | You need context or want to act on a workspace |

| Cockpit action | Result                                                         | Direct key   |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------ |
| Start          | Create a linked worktree, choose an agent, and begin the task  | `prefix + W` |
| Review         | Show agents waiting, failed, or ready for review               | —            |
| Jump           | Open a live agent workspace                                    | `prefix + w` |
| Finish         | Remove a clean, integrated worktree while retaining its branch | `prefix + X` |

<img src="docs/images/design/lifecycle-flow.png" alt="Lifecycle flow diagram: start task creates a worktree, the agent moves to working, then needs attention when waiting or failed, then review when idle and ready, then finish safely once clean and merged">

Finish refuses primary checkouts, dirty worktrees, and branches not integrated
into the configured base branch.

### Responsive layout

I work on Linux and almost always in a tiling window manager so having a modicum of responsive layout is a must.

<img src="docs/images/design/responsive-layouts.png" alt="The status bar at three widths: wide showing every workspace and agent, narrow collapsing inactive workspace labels to an arrow, and compact under 80 columns sharing project, Git, lifecycle, and navigator cues in one flow">

Workspace, Git, lifecycle, and navigation context remain visible as the
terminal narrows; labels collapse before information collides.

## Use

| Key              | Action                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `prefix + H`     | Open help (`q` or Escape closes it)            |
| `prefix + P`     | Open the Workspace Cockpit                     |
| `prefix + w`     | Open the grouped workspace navigator           |
| `prefix + C-w`   | Open tmux's native window tree                 |
| `prefix + s`     | Open the compact session navigator             |
| `prefix + S`     | Open tmux's native session tree                |
| `prefix + C-s`   | Save all sessions (tmux-resurrect)              |
| `prefix + a`     | Jump to the oldest agent needing attention     |
| `prefix + W`     | Create a worktree and start an agent           |
| `prefix + X`     | Finish the selected clean, integrated worktree |
| `prefix + Space` | Toggle the optional legacy sidebar             |
| `prefix + A`     | Recreate a stuck legacy sidebar                |

Inside either navigator, these shortcuts act on the selected item:

| Key | Action |
| --- | --- |
| `j` / `k` or arrow keys | Move selection |
| `Enter` | Switch to the selected session or window |
| `/` | Filter the list |
| `r` | Rename the selected session (`prefix + s`) or window (`prefix + w`) |
| `x` | Kill the selected item after confirmation |
| `s` | Save all sessions with tmux-resurrect |
| `Esc` / `q` | Close the navigator |

Renaming starts with the current name. Use `Backspace` to delete, `Enter` to
apply, and `Esc` to cancel. The navigator stays open and reports any error so
you can correct the name. Press `s` afterward to save the updated layout with
Resurrect.

Inside either navigator, select an item and press `x`, then `y` to confirm killing
it (`Esc` or `n` cancels). In `prefix + w`, this kills the selected tmux window
and all its panes, including any links to that window in other sessions. In
`prefix + s`, it kills the selected session; windows linked to another session
survive. Running processes in closed panes stop. Git worktrees and files remain
on disk. The list refreshes after a kill; killing the session hosting the popup
may close it and detach its clients.

Existing tmux window navigation, naming, and pane zoom continue to work.

## Agent integrations

Automatic terminal classification works without setup. Optional hooks provide
exact lifecycle transitions and take precedence over observation.

| Agent              | Integration                                  | Without it           |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------- | -------------------- |
| Codex CLI 0.151.0+ | Lifecycle hooks in `~/.codex/config.toml`    | Terminal observation |
| Claude Code        | Lifecycle hooks in `~/.claude/settings.json` | Terminal observation |
| OpenCode           | Local event plugin                           | Terminal observation |

<details>
<summary>Codex CLI hooks</summary>

Replace `/path/to` with the plugin checkout:

```toml
[hooks]
userPromptSubmit = [{ type = "command", command = "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/codex-hook.sh userPromptSubmit" }]
permissionRequest = [{ type = "command", command = "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/codex-hook.sh permissionRequest" }]
stop = [{ type = "command", command = "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/codex-hook.sh stop" }]
interrupt = [{ type = "command", command = "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/codex-hook.sh interrupt" }]
```

Review and trust the commands when Codex prompts you.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Claude Code hooks</summary>

Hooks keep the display current by refreshing it after relevant tmux events.

Add this inside the `hooks` object in `~/.claude/settings.json`, replacing
`/path/to` with the plugin checkout:

```json
{
  "UserPromptSubmit": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/claude-hook.sh UserPromptSubmit"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "PermissionRequest": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/claude-hook.sh PermissionRequest"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "Stop": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/claude-hook.sh Stop"
        }
      ]
    }
  ],
  "StopFailure": [
    {
      "hooks": [
        {
          "type": "command",
          "command": "/path/to/tmux-agent-watch/scripts/claude-hook.sh StopFailure"
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

</details>

<details>
<summary>OpenCode plugin</summary>
Optional. Relays OpenCode lifecycle events for immediate, exact status updates. Without it, terminal observation still works.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/.config/opencode/plugins
cp /path/to/tmux-agent-watch/integrations/opencode-agent-watch.js \
  ~/.config/opencode/plugins/tmux-agent-watch.js
```

Replace `/path/to` inside the copied file with the plugin checkout.

</details>

Hooks ignore event payload content and use the inherited `TMUX_PANE` to update
the correct window. See [Privacy and local data flow](docs/privacy.md) for the
full data boundary.

## Configure

and `@agent-watch-{working,needs-input,done,failed}-symbol`.

</details>

## Worktrees from the command line

Use the cockpit for everyday work. For automation, the same workspace actions are also available as command-line scripts:

```sh
scripts/worktree-new.sh feature/auth opencode
scripts/worktree-new.sh --repo /path/to/repository feature/auth opencode
scripts/worktree-remove.sh feature/auth
```

Extra arguments after the branch are used as the exact agent command. Set
`AGENT_WATCH_WORKTREE_ROOT` to change the worktree parent directory. Removal
refuses dirty worktrees and retains the branch.

## Session persistence

Live state is stored in tmux window options. Use `tmux-resurrect` and
`tmux-continuum` to restore sessions, windows, layouts, and working directories.
Load Continuum after themes that replace `status-right`.

Press `s` inside either navigator to save **all sessions** through the installed
Resurrect plugin without closing the navigator. The footer reports the result.
After cleaning up windows or sessions, save before exiting tmux so the next
restore uses the updated layout. Kills do not automatically save; if killing the
session hosting the popup closes it, reopen a navigator in a remaining session
and save there.

Resurrect's default global save shortcut is `prefix + Ctrl+s`. Agent Watch leaves
that key available and puts the native session tree on `prefix + Shift+s`.
If upgrading from a version that used `Ctrl+s` for the native tree, reload your
tmux configuration with Resurrect enabled to restore its save binding. Remove
any explicit `@agent-watch-native-session-key C-s` override that would reclaim it.

Saving requires `tmux-resurrect` to be loaded. Agent Watch delegates to its
`@resurrect-save-script-path` and creates no separate snapshot. Resurrect controls
what is saved, including pane contents if you enabled its capture option.

## Maintainers

Release tags must match the Cargo package version. GitHub Actions builds and
checksums Linux and macOS archives for x86_64 and ARM64. Before tagging, run the
release workflow manually and complete the
[preflight checklist](docs/preflight-checklist.md) against its `release-bundle`.

## Scope

Great care was taken to make the project privacy-driven and fully AI-compliant to the best of my abilities.
The plugin does not retain task history, track tokens, or create a separate
project model. tmux remains the interface and process supervisor. Employee
monitoring, productivity scoring, and decisions about people are outside its
intended purpose. See [Privacy and local data flow](docs/privacy.md) before
organisational deployment.
